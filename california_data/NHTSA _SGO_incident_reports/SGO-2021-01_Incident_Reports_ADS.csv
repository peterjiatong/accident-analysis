On August 16th, 2023 at 6:11 PM PT, a Waymo AV operating in San Francisco, California was stopped at a red light in the dedicated left turn lane on the left side of northeast-bound [XXX] at the intersection with [XXX]. While the light was red, a fire engine approached the Waymo AV from behind and the Waymo AV moved forward as far as possible before entering the intersection at [XXX]. After the light turned green and as the Waymo AV was calculating a path into the intersection to clear the way, the fire engine maneuvered around the Waymo AV on the right side. During this maneuver, the right side of the fire engine appears to have made contact with the front left corner of an SUV that was stopped in the through lane to the right of the Waymo AV. The fire engine then proceeded through the intersection, and shortly afterwards, another fire engine and a fire department SUV passed on the left side the Waymo AV of the stopped Waymo AV. The Waymo AV then proceeded through the intersection.
At the time of the collision, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The SUV sustained damage.

The Ghost vehicle neither hit nor was hit by another vehicle.  The Ghost car was traveling in AV mode with two safety drivers.  Traffic slowed quickly, apparently due to a crash ahead of the Ghost car.  Consistent with their training, the Ghost driver took control of the car by manually braking and disengaging the autonomous system.  The car was traveling 55.3 mph when the driver began to brake.  The Ghost car stopped without impacting the preceding car.  A Mercedes car immediately following the Ghost car also came to a stop without impacting the Ghost car.  Ghost's understanding based on communications at the scene is that a Grand Cherokee traveling behind the Mercedes tried to swerve to avoid impacting the Mercedes but clipped the Mercedes and rolled over.  To Ghost's knowledge, nobody in the Grand Cherokee was injured.  The Ghost drivers heard a noise and then found that the rear bumper of the Ghost car had been damaged, which Ghost believes resulted from crash debris. The Ghost drivers drove the Ghost car back to the garage in conventional mode.",

On [XXX], 2023 at 1:17 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in Phoenix, AZ was in a collision involving a passenger car on [XXX] in the southbound direction near the [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling in the rightmost lane (out of 5 lanes) in the southbound direction of [XXX],  and the left 3 lanes were closed due to a work zone. The vehicle traveling ahead in the same lane as the ADV made an abrupt lane change to the left, revealing a stack of slow-moving vehicles in the Waymo AVs lane. The test driver of the Waymo AV took manual control of the vehicle and started to decelerate and steer toward the right shoulder in response to slow traffic ahead. A passenger vehicle approached the Waymo AV from behind and made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver (in the drivers seating position) was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV and the other vehicle sustained damage. The test driver reported an injury, for which they later sought medical treatment.

The May shuttle began to slow for traffic ahead, which was stopping for a red light, but the following vehicle did not decelerate. While slowing, the May shuttle identified a bollard on the side of the road as a likely pedestrian and added a safety buffer which intersected with the predicted trajectory of the shuttle. This caused the shuttle to increase deceleration to avoid the projected collision with the buffer. The following vehicle started braking late and impacted the May shuttle from behind with a relative velocity of 6.2 m/s.

At 11:01 am, while running the normal route, the Olli contacted the adjacent curb on the front right side, causing tie rod and cosmetic damage. No one was injured and the only damage was to the vehicle itself. The customer contacted RRAI through the client support portal shortly after the incident. No injuries occurred, there were no passengers besides the safety operator, no other vehicles were involved, and no emergency systems were engaged.
Olli 2.0 (S/N 2-18) is an 8-passenger shuttle that is no longer manufactured. The vehicle manufacturer, Local Motors, dissolved in 2022. Local Motors contracted RRAI to install autonomy kits for several Olli shuttles during the period of 2018 - 2020. RRAI provided some support for initial site deployment and ensured customer safety operators were trained on the autonomy system. Since the Local Motors dissolution in 2022, almost all Olli vehicles have been decommissioned.
To date, we have concluded the following:
1. There were no updates or alterations made by RRAI in the months prior to Jan [XXX]. In previous operations, including the immediately preceding operations on January 20th, 2023, Olli 2-18 ran the route as normal with no anomalies. There were no software updates or other system changes before it was run again on January [XXX], 2023, the date of curb contact.
2. The root cause of the curb contact was a communication error with the HD Map registration module. HD Map registration utilizes real-time lidar and positioning data and compares that to a-priori HD maps stored within the autonomy system. A communication problem occurred between the computer running the map registration software and the computer running the navigation algorithms. The cause for the communication problem has been identified and a fix has been implemented to prevent the issue from happening again (see below).
3. Steering was out of calibration. It was noted through data collection that the steering was out of calibration at time of incident. The autonomy system was attempting to correct this issue, but the vehicular steering system could not achieve the required turn radius. This is a vehicular maintenance concern managed by the customer.
It was determined that the HD map registration issue had not been observed during autonomous operations in the previous four years. The solution to prevent further occurrences includes:
1. Implementing a self-diagnostic routine upon system boot, which ensures the communication connection is established. If the connection is not established, this diagnostic will prevent the vehicle from driving autonomously. 
2. Updating the error checks to ensure that during run time, the vehicle will come to a controlled stop in event of a communication problem.

On January [XXX], 2023 at 1:38 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in Phoenix, Arizona was in a collision with a minibike whose rider was no longer on it on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling in the leftmost lane on eastbound [XXX], with a group of smaller motorcycles, more commonly known as minibikes, traveling in the right adjacent lane next to and ahead of the Waymo AV. A minibike rider in the group lost control and fell off the minibike a short distance ahead of the Waymo AV in the adjacent lane and the minibike, without a rider, tumbled into the Waymo AV's lane. The Waymo AV applied maximum brake force but made contact with the riderless minibike just before coming to a stop. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage. The minibike was damaged but it is not possible to determine whether all or some of that damage occurred when the minibike fell to the road before the collision. Because we checked on the minibike riders well-being shortly after the crash, Waymo is aware that the individual sustained minor injuries when they fell from the minibike but the subsequent collision with the riderless minibike did not cause those injuries.
Although we do not believe this event falls under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01, we consulted NHTSA and submitted this report at the agencys request on the day of the consultation.

Due to road construction the vehicle followed the lane markings, which switch southbound traffic to a designated lane on the northbound side of the road. Online weather information for the area indicates sunset was at approximately 5pm and it was cloudy and rainy. Telematics indicate the vehicle was traveling at 70 mph a few seconds prior to the crash and the pre-crash speed was 43 mph. The customer called Lucid Customer Care and reported that he hit a pothole and the vehicle veered into the concrete barrier dividing the southbound traffic from the northbound traffic, resulting in the left driver side curtain air bag being deployed on impact. The vehicle was towed following the crash.  The customer reported that no one was injured. Telematics indicate Lucid's Highway Assist feature (SAE Level 2) was active until approximately 3 seconds prior to the accident, when HWA deactivated due to inability to detect the lane markings, most likely due to environmental conditions. The driver distraction warning feature had been turned off. At the time of HWA deactivation, and through the crash time, telematics indicates the customer had hands on the steering wheel and was actively steering. Vehicle acceleration data approximately 1 second prior to the crash is consistent with the driver's report of hitting a pothole. Vehicle acceleration data and the side curtain airbag deployment are consistent with the driver's report of hitting the concrete barrier separating southbound from northbound traffic.

While driving along [XXX] under autonomous control, the shuttle encountered a parked vehicle partially blocking its path, requiring disengagement of the autonomous drive system.  The safety driver attempted to manually drive the shuttle around the parked vehicle to reengage the autonomous drive system.  While manually steering the shuttle around the parked vehicle blocking its path, the shuttle failed to respond to manual control input and steered to the left, impacting a parked vehicle at a low rate of speed on the opposite side of [XXX].  The six passengers onboard alighted the shuttle, an accident report was filed with the local police, and the shuttle was removed from the scene.  Initial reports from the onboard safety driver indicated that while steering around the vehicle blocking the shuttle's path, the shuttle became unresponsive to control input.  The safety driver released the operator present button on the vehicle controller, which serves as dead man switch however, the vehicle failed to stop.  After the incident, further investigation by Navya confirmed that the root cause of the incident was a failure of the Xbox 360 controller used to manually control the vehicle.  Contact with the parked vehicle occurred between the time of failure and the vehicle drive system recognizing that the controller had failed an elapsed time of 4.05 seconds. In response to the incident, Beep suspended operation of all Navya ARMA vehicles pending identification and implementation of appropriate solutions to mitigate the risk of this failure leading to future incidents.
Subsequent investigation by Beep and Navya determined that the vehicle control software, NavyaDrive, is limited in its ability to monitor the validity of control signal input received from the Xbox 360 controller.  As the safety driver began to manually steer the vehicle, the controller failed, sending constant turning input to the vehicle drive system leading to the collision.  Though Navya developed software mitigations due to prior issues encountered with the controller, those mitigations were ineffective with respect to the failure leading to the incident on December [XXX].  Further, due to the short time between the controller failing and the collision (2.34sec), the safety driver was unable to identify the controller failure and trigger the emergency stop before the collision occurred.
In response to the incident, Navya is integrating a revised manual control system on the ARMA shuttle platform.  The revised manual control system utilizes industrial-grade components for improved electromechanical reliability and allows for active monitoring of the control system health, eliminating the root cause of the failure that led to the incident on December [XXX].  Software upgrades of all Navya ARMA vehicles will further reintroduce automated braking function while the ARMA vehicle is under manual control.  Beep is working with Navya to retrofit its fleet of ARMA vehicles with the revised manual control system as well as retrain and recertify its safety driver staff on the updated NavyaDrive software.
Discussion of the root cause analysis and solution design for the revised manual control system will be provided to NHTSA as a supplement to this report.",

The Subject Vehicle included Lucid ""Highway Assist"" (HWA) which is Level 2 ADAS technology under development by Lucid in collaboration with its suppliers. The HWA function combines lane-keeping and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), but is not yet available on vehicles that Lucid sells to the public. As a Level 2 technology, HWA requires the attention of the driver at all times and is not expected to avoid all accidents.
 
On 7/[XXX]/2022 at approximately 3:58 am, a contract test driver was driving a Lucid Air northbound on [XXX] at approximately 70 MPH. The driver reported that he engaged HWA and subsequently ""blacked out, passed out, or fainted."" The driver's supervisor initially reported that the driver fell asleep. The driver reported that he has not sought medical attention following the incident. Telemetered data confirms engagement of HWA and indicates that the driver imparted sufficient torque on the steering wheel to override HWA. When HWA is overridden, it no longer provides lane-keeping and ACC remains active. Approximately 15 seconds later, the vehicle drifted out of its lane and impacted its left side against the roadside barrier on the left side of the road. The driver awoke after the impact and brought the vehicle to a stop on the side of the freeway. Lucid roadside assistance was contacted to tow the vehicle. No airbags deployed.

The safety operator suggested that the safety driver disengage the ADS and make the turn in manual mode because the vehicle was hesitant in approaching the intersection. The safety driver disengaged the ADS, and, approximately 250ms later, subject vehicle was lightly struck from behind by a white Mazda3.  Having seen debris on the roadway, the driver and operator believed they had run over a rock and did not realize they were hit by the vehicle. After concluding the mission, the driver and operator found damage to a sensor during an inspection.  A subsequent review of video led to discovery of the crash.

TuSimple's position is that this event does not meet the criteria for reporting under the SGO.
Specifically, the L4 ADS was not in operation at any point in the 30 seconds prior to making contact with the concrete barrier.
The event occurred as follows:
As the truck was being operated on the highway, within its mapped ODD, the driver and test engineer attempted to engage the ADS.
However, the ADS was not functional at that moment due to the computer unit not having been initialized, and should not have been
attempted to be activated. In short, this was a failed attempt to engage the system as a result of human error.
The system has now been modified to prevent the ADS from attempting to engage unless the health of the system is fully functional to
prevent human error from repeating this event.
When the erroneous attempt to engage occurred, the uninitialized vehicle control unit rotated the steering to the left, causing the truck to
veer left. The safety driver took control of the steering, and was able to steer accordingly, but not before the left front truck tire and left
front quarter panel came into contact with the concrete barrier to the left of the lanes of travel.",

The Beep shuttle attendant was traveling Southbound on [XXX] at approx 7-12 mph in ADS and headed towards the intersection of [XXX]. Beep vehicle stopped at red light at intersection. As the Beep vehicle was crossing the intersection in manual and slowing to a stop to return to ADS in a southbound direction, the trailing bus made light contact with its bicycle rack to the Beep shuttle rear end. The trailing vehicle is a bus owned and operated by the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority (PSTA). According to video, as reported by the shuttle attendant and the PSTA Road Supervisor, the bus was tailgating. 
 
Root Cause: Trailing vehicle following too closely and not observing Navya slowing to a stop.",

The May vehicle passed too close to a parked vehicle, causing the May vehicle's passenger-side mirror to contact the parked vehicle's driver-side mirror.
The May vehicle's ground mapping module had fallen significantly behind in its processing of lidar data. As a result, actual objects were being filtered out of the lidar data during object detection. This filtering caused the truck to oscillate between being detected, detecting only the cab, detecting the cab and mirror, and not being detected at all.
After assessing the issue, it has been determined that ground map latency alone will not cause safety issues. There is no risk to VRUs, or anything at ground level. The issue was with something in the air (mirror), above the ground.
A permanent fix to address the ground map latency issue is in process and will be implemented in the entire fleet within the next 30 days.
The second factor in the collision is that we were artificially constraining the vehicle to the right side of the road due to ambiguous and unpainted roadway. If we change that constraint to an advisory line (and allow the vehicle to cross the line to the left), we would have been far enough to the left to avoid collision (simulation success).
Solution Implementation: AVO training for extra caution related to protruding items like mirrors (short term), software changes coming in the next update and hotfix (within 30 days), and further improvement in the following update (within 60 days).
Until the tested software changes are implemented, we have advised the AVOs to take extra caution in these scenarios and to continue to disengage autonomy when desired. As always, we sacrifice autonomy for safety, as needed.",

On May [XXX], 2022 at 3:11 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) Peterbilt Class 8 semi-truck and trailer, operating in Ennis, Texas was in a collision involving a Class 8 semi-truck and trailer on northbound Interstate [XXX] near [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was traveling in autonomous mode in the rightmost lane on Interstate [XXX] when a Class 8 semi-truck and trailer began to pass it in the adjacent left lane. Before the adjacent Class 8 semi-truck and trailer had fully passed the Waymo AV, it encountered tire debris in its lane, executed a right lane change, and its trailer (the right side, rear section) entered the lane in which the Waymo AV was traveling and made contact with the driver side of the Waymo AV cab. The Waymo AV transitioned to manual mode and the test driver took control. The Waymo AV exited the roadway to the right shoulder of the road and came to a stop off of the roadway. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's ADS was engaged in autonomous mode, and a test driver was present (in the driver's seating position). The Waymo AV sustained moderate damage and the third-party Class 8 semi-truck and trailer did not stop to exchange information. The Waymo AV test driver was transported for medical care and the Waymo AV software operator, seated in the passenger seat, later sought medical attention. 
Waymo is reporting this crash under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01 because an individual involved in the crash was transported from the scene to a hospital for medical treatment and a vehicle involved was towed away.

Specifically, the L4 ADS was not in operation at any point in the 30 seconds prior to making contact with the concrete barrier.  
 
The event occurred as follows:
As the truck was being operated on the highway, within its mapped ODD, the driver and test engineer attempted to engage the ADS.  However, the ADS was not functional at that moment due to the computer unit not having been initialized, and should not have been attempted to be activated.  In short, this was a failed attempt to engage the system as a result of human error.  
 
The system has now been modified to prevent the ADS from attempting to engage unless the health of the system is fully functional to prevent human error from repeating this event.
 
When the erroneous attempt to engage occurred, the uninitialized vehicle control unit rotated the steering to the left, causing the truck to veer left.  The safety driver took control of the steering, and was able to steer accordingly, but not before the left front truck tire and left front quarter panel came into contact with the concrete barrier to the left of the lanes of travel.  
 
The contact resulted in a scuff to the left tire and damage to the radar unit extending from the left quarter panel.",

As required by the SGO, Pony.ai submitted a ""10-day"" update to the amended report on November [XXX], 2021. Subsequently, in a November [XXX], 2021 meeting with NHTSA, Pony.ai presented a full report regarding the crash and material facts and circumstances to a number of NHTSA officials, and answered the agency's questions. This supplemental ""Other"" Report is intended only to provide two minor technical corrections to Pony.ai's prior reports, in order to ensure the details of the written reports, as revised, are accurate. This is not a ""1-Day"", ""Monthly"" or ""Monthly-No Incidents"" Report. To facilitate a clear record, this ""Other"" Updated Report reproduces verbatim the narrative descriptions from the prior reports concerning this incident. 
UNEDITED NARRATIVE FROM ORIGINAL MONTHLY REPORT (11/[XXX]/21) AND AMENDED REPORT (11/[XXX]/21): On October [XXX], 2021, after turning right onto [XXX] from [XXX], the Pony.ai Autonomous Vehicle (""Pony.ai AV"") performed a left lane change maneuver in autonomous mode (SAE L4). While performing the lane change, the Pony.ai AV came into contact with a center divider on [XXX]. and the traffic sign that was posted on the divider. The Pony.ai AV suffered moderate damage to the front of the vehicle and the undercarriage. There were no injuries and no other vehicles involved. Fremont Police Department were called to report the incident and the damaged street sign. Pony.ai has subsequently worked with local authorities to resolve all issues related to the damaged sign. Please note that the latitude/longitude provided are GPS coordinates of the location address.
UNEDITED ADDITIONAL NARRATIVE FROM 10-DAY UPDATE: NHTSA has requested the Company to debrief the Agency on this incident. That meeting is scheduled for November 30, 2021.  Pony.ai will present a full updated report of the incident to NHTSA at that time and the current status of the Company's investigation.
TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS FOR THIS ""OTHER"" UPDATED REPORT (12/15/2021): Pony.ai provides the following corrections to its prior reports on the incident: (1) The Pony.ai AV did not turn onto [XXX] from [XXX] as first reported. Rather the Pony.ai AV was traveling straight on [XXX] and crossed through an intersection with [XXX] before entering the segment of [XXX] on which it changed lanes and subsequently had a collision; (2) Pony.ai has updated the VIN number of the subject vehicle in the data fields above, as there was one digit that was incorrect in our original reports due to a clerical error.",

On September [XXX], 2021 at 1:54 PM PDT, a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle ('Waymo AV') operating in Tempe, AZ was in a collision involving a pickup truck on [XXX] near [XXX]. While in autonomous mode, the Waymo AV began to enter the right lane of a protected double left turn lane (""Lane 2"") from northbound [XXX] to westbound [XXX]. A pickup truck heading southbound on [XXX] had completely crossed the double-yellow lines of the northbound double left turn lanes and positioned itself in the left lane of the double turn lane (""Lane 1"") facing the wrong direction against traffic and was preparing to make a left turn across Lane 2 and the other two northbound lanes into a shopping center parking lot on the east side of [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was traveling in Lane 2 when the pickup truck began to initiate its left turn from Lane 1. The Waymo AV braked, and the trained human driver in the Waymo AV (in the driver's seating position), transitioned the vehicle from autonomous to manual mode. As the pickup truck made the left turn, the driver's side panels of the pickup truck made contact with the driver's side rear corner of the Waymo AV causing moderate damage to the Waymo AV. Damage to the pickup is currently unknown. At the time of contact, the Waymo AV was in manual mode.
Waymo is reporting this crash under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01 because the Waymo AV was towed from the scene. Waymo may supplement or correct its reporting with additional information as it may become available. This report was submitted from the Pacific time zone on the required date, which in this case was the next business day after a weekend.",

Summary of incident (as Toyota received from May Mobility):
Leading up to the event, the autonomy system functioned as expected, following the route through the intersection, slowing appropriately for other road users and the red light. Vehicle autonomous behavior was performing as expected and did not require a takeover.
Description of event:
16:17:30 May vehicle, traveling East on [XXX], in full working order with no errors, autonomously navigates the [XXX] and [XXX] intersection.
16:17:35 May vehicle autonomously begins to slow to match the speed of a vehicle several car lengths ahead merging into our lane from the right.
16:17:37 By means of an accelerator pedal push the vehicle is moved into manual mode by the safety operator - from this point forward, the vehicle remains under control of the safety operator.
16:17:43 Manual acceleration command via the pedal increases.
16:17:44 Safety operator manually continues straight which, due to the slight change in angle of the road, brings the May vehicle into contact with the first vehicle to the right.
16:17:44 Safety operator manually applies brake.
16:17:45 With the manual brake command now at maximum the May vehicle makes contact with the second vehicle.
Vehicle indicators for manual or autonomy mode:
The visual indicator for autonomy was functioning properly and as expected in the time leading up to and during the event.
The audio communication device in the vehicle was functioning properly and was used to call for assistance and to report the incident.
The audio beep to indicate a state change was functioning properly.
The safety operator had some audio indication that he had exited autonomy and entered manual operation, and he had full visual indication on his dashboard.",
