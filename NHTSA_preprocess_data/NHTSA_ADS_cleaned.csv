The Ghost car stopped without impacting the preceding car.  A Mercedes car immediately following the Ghost car also came to a stop without impacting the Ghost car.

On [XXX], 2023 at 1:17 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in Phoenix, AZ was in a collision involving a passenger car on [XXX] in the southbound direction near the [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling in the rightmost lane (out of 5 lanes) in the southbound direction of [XXX],  and the left 3 lanes were closed due to a work zone. The vehicle traveling ahead in the same lane as the ADV made an abrupt lane change to the left, revealing a stack of slow-moving vehicles in the Waymo AVs lane. The test driver of the Waymo AV took manual control of the vehicle and started to decelerate and steer toward the right shoulder in response to slow traffic ahead. A passenger vehicle approached the Waymo AV from behind and made contact with the rear of the Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was not engaged and a test driver (in the drivers seating position) was operating the Waymo AV in manual mode. The Waymo AV and the other vehicle sustained damage. The test driver reported an injury, for which they later sought medical treatment.

The following vehicle was traveling approximately twice as fast as the May shuttle and catching up to the May shuttle from behind. The May shuttle began to slow for traffic ahead, which was stopping for a red light, but the following vehicle did not decelerate. While slowing, the May shuttle identified a bollard on the side of the road as a likely pedestrian and added a safety buffer which intersected with the predicted trajectory of the shuttle. This caused the shuttle to increase deceleration to avoid the projected collision with the buffer. The following vehicle started braking late and impacted the May shuttle from behind with a relative velocity of 6.2 m/s.

At 11:01 am, while running the normal route, the Olli contacted the adjacent curb on the front right side, causing tie rod and cosmetic damage. No one was injured and the only damage was to the vehicle itself. The customer contacted RRAI through the client support portal shortly after the incident. No injuries occurred, there were no passengers besides the safety operator, no other vehicles were involved, and no emergency systems were engaged.
Olli 2.0 (S/N 2-18) is an 8-passenger shuttle that is no longer manufactured. The vehicle manufacturer, Local Motors, dissolved in 2022. Local Motors contracted RRAI to install autonomy kits for several Olli shuttles during the period of 2018 - 2020. RRAI provided some support for initial site deployment and ensured customer safety operators were trained on the autonomy system. Since the Local Motors dissolution in 2022, almost all Olli vehicles have been decommissioned.
To date, we have concluded the following:
1. There were no updates or alterations made by RRAI in the months prior to Jan [XXX]. In previous operations, including the immediately preceding operations on January 20th, 2023, Olli 2-18 ran the route as normal with no anomalies. There were no software updates or other system changes before it was run again on January [XXX], 2023, the date of curb contact.
2. The root cause of the curb contact was a communication error with the HD Map registration module. HD Map registration utilizes real-time lidar and positioning data and compares that to a-priori HD maps stored within the autonomy system. A communication problem occurred between the computer running the map registration software and the computer running the navigation algorithms. The cause for the communication problem has been identified and a fix has been implemented to prevent the issue from happening again (see below).
3. Steering was out of calibration. It was noted through data collection that the steering was out of calibration at time of incident. The autonomy system was attempting to correct this issue, but the vehicular steering system could not achieve the required turn radius. This is a vehicular maintenance concern managed by the customer.
It was determined that the HD map registration issue had not been observed during autonomous operations in the previous four years. The solution to prevent further occurrences includes:
1. Implementing a self-diagnostic routine upon system boot, which ensures the communication connection is established. If the connection is not established, this diagnostic will prevent the vehicle from driving autonomously. 
2. Updating the error checks to ensure that during run time, the vehicle will come to a controlled stop in event of a communication problem.  
3. Working with the customer to recalibrate the steering, and assisting in reviewing customer's vehicle maintenance checks for steering calibration if necessary.
4. Continuing to review data to determine other concerns or improvements.",

On January [XXX], 2023 at 1:38 PM PST a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in Phoenix, Arizona was in a collision with a minibike whose rider was no longer on it on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling in the leftmost lane on eastbound [XXX], with a group of smaller motorcycles, more commonly known as minibikes, traveling in the right adjacent lane next to and ahead of the Waymo AV. A minibike rider in the group lost control and fell off the minibike a short distance ahead of the Waymo AV in the adjacent lane and the minibike, without a rider, tumbled into the Waymo AV's lane. The Waymo AV applied maximum brake force but made contact with the riderless minibike just before coming to a stop. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained damage. The minibike was damaged but it is not possible to determine whether all or some of that damage occurred when the minibike fell to the road before the collision. Because we checked on the minibike riders well-being shortly after the crash, Waymo is aware that the individual sustained minor injuries when they fell from the minibike but the subsequent collision with the riderless minibike did not cause those injuries.
Although we do not believe this event falls under Request No. 1 of Standing General Order 2021-01, we consulted NHTSA and submitted this report at the agencys request on the day of the consultation.

Due to road construction the vehicle followed the lane markings, which switch southbound traffic to a designated lane on the northbound side of the road. Online weather information for the area indicates sunset was at approximately 5pm and it was cloudy and rainy. Telematics indicate the vehicle was traveling at 70 mph a few seconds prior to the crash and the pre-crash speed was 43 mph. The customer called Lucid Customer Care and reported that he hit a pothole and the vehicle veered into the concrete barrier dividing the southbound traffic from the northbound traffic, resulting in the left driver side curtain air bag being deployed on impact. The vehicle was towed following the crash.  The customer reported that no one was injured. Telematics indicate Lucid's Highway Assist feature (SAE Level 2) was active until approximately 3 seconds prior to the accident, when HWA deactivated due to inability to detect the lane markings, most likely due to environmental conditions. The driver distraction warning feature had been turned off. At the time of HWA deactivation, and through the crash time, telematics indicates the customer had hands on the steering wheel and was actively steering. Vehicle acceleration data approximately 1 second prior to the crash is consistent with the driver's report of hitting a pothole. Vehicle acceleration data and the side curtain airbag deployment are consistent with the driver's report of hitting the concrete barrier separating southbound from northbound traffic.

While driving along [XXX] under autonomous control, the shuttle encountered a parked vehicle partially blocking its path, requiring disengagement of the autonomous drive system.  The safety driver attempted to manually drive the shuttle around the parked vehicle to reengage the autonomous drive system.  While manually steering the shuttle around the parked vehicle blocking its path, the shuttle failed to respond to manual control input and steered to the left, impacting a parked vehicle at a low rate of speed on the opposite side of [XXX].  The six passengers onboard alighted the shuttle, an accident report was filed with the local police, and the shuttle was removed from the scene.  Initial reports from the onboard safety driver indicated that while steering around the vehicle blocking the shuttle's path, the shuttle became unresponsive to control input.  The safety driver released the operator present button on the vehicle controller, which serves as dead man switch however, the vehicle failed to stop.  After the incident, further investigation by Navya confirmed that the root cause of the incident was a failure of the Xbox 360 controller used to manually control the vehicle.  Contact with the parked vehicle occurred between the time of failure and the vehicle drive system recognizing that the controller had failed an elapsed time of 4.05 seconds. In response to the incident, Beep suspended operation of all Navya ARMA vehicles pending identification and implementation of appropriate solutions to mitigate the risk of this failure leading to future incidents.
Subsequent investigation by Beep and Navya determined that the vehicle control software, NavyaDrive, is limited in its ability to monitor the validity of control signal input received from the Xbox 360 controller.  As the safety driver began to manually steer the vehicle, the controller failed, sending constant turning input to the vehicle drive system leading to the collision.  Though Navya developed software mitigations due to prior issues encountered with the controller, those mitigations were ineffective with respect to the failure leading to the incident on December [XXX].  Further, due to the short time between the controller failing and the collision (2.34sec), the safety driver was unable to identify the controller failure and trigger the emergency stop before the collision occurred.
In response to the incident, Navya is integrating a revised manual control system on the ARMA shuttle platform.  The revised manual control system utilizes industrial-grade components for improved electromechanical reliability and allows for active monitoring of the control system health, eliminating the root cause of the failure that led to the incident on December [XXX].  Software upgrades of all Navya ARMA vehicles will further reintroduce automated braking function while the ARMA vehicle is under manual control.  Beep is working with Navya to retrofit its fleet of ARMA vehicles with the revised manual control system as well as retrain and recertify its safety driver staff on the updated NavyaDrive software.
Discussion of the root cause analysis and solution design for the revised manual control system will be provided to NHTSA as a supplement to this report.",

The Waymo AV was in autonomous mode and preparing to enter southbound [XXX] via the slip lane at southbound [XXX]. The Waymo AV proceeded to merge onto [XXX] as a passenger vehicle on [XXX] approached from behind. A pickup truck was traveling next to the passenger vehicle in the adjacent left lane. As the passenger vehicle approached the Waymo AV from behind, the passenger vehicle entered the adjacent left lane that was occupied by the pickup truck and maneuvered around the Waymo AV. The pickup truck proceeded without stopping, and the passenger vehicles driver shortly after signaled to the Waymo AV test driver to pull over. The Waymo AV test driver then transitioned to manual mode and pulled over. Waymo has no data or knowledge of any contact between any of the three vehicles. There was no contact or collision between the Waymo AV and any other vehicle. However, the driver and passenger in the passenger vehicle have subsequently alleged injuries based on alleged contact between the pick-up truck and passenger vehicle, which contact their allegations attribute to the behavior of Waymos AV in a bodily injury claim under Waymos insurance policy.  Waymo received notice of this insurance claim on July [XXX].

The HWA function combines lane-keeping and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), but is not yet available on vehicles that Lucid sells to the public.

The driver reported that he engaged HWA and subsequently ""blacked out, passed out, or fainted."" The driver's supervisor initially reported that the driver fell asleep. The driver reported that he has not sought medical attention following the incident. Telemetered data confirms engagement of HWA and indicates that the driver imparted sufficient torque on the steering wheel to override HWA. When HWA is overridden, it no longer provides lane-keeping and ACC remains active. Approximately 15 seconds later, the vehicle drifted out of its lane and impacted its left side against the roadside barrier on the left side of the road.

TuSimple's position is that this event does not meet the criteria for reporting under the SGO.
Specifically, the L4 ADS was not in operation at any point in the 30 seconds prior to making contact with the concrete barrier.
The event occurred as follows:
As the truck was being operated on the highway, within its mapped ODD, the driver and test engineer attempted to engage the ADS.
However, the ADS was not functional at that moment due to the computer unit not having been initialized, and should not have been
attempted to be activated. In short, this was a failed attempt to engage the system as a result of human error.
The system has now been modified to prevent the ADS from attempting to engage unless the health of the system is fully functional to
prevent human error from repeating this event.
When the erroneous attempt to engage occurred, the uninitialized vehicle control unit rotated the steering to the left, causing the truck to
veer left. The safety driver took control of the steering, and was able to steer accordingly, but not before the left front truck tire and left
front quarter panel came into contact with the concrete barrier to the left of the lanes of travel.",

The May vehicle passed too close to a parked vehicle, causing the May vehicle's passenger-side mirror to contact the parked vehicle's driver-side mirror.
The May vehicle's ground mapping module had fallen significantly behind in its processing of lidar data. As a result, actual objects were being filtered out of the lidar data during object detection. This filtering caused the truck to oscillate between being detected, detecting only the cab, detecting the cab and mirror, and not being detected at all.
After assessing the issue, it has been determined that ground map latency alone will not cause safety issues. There is no risk to VRUs, or anything at ground level. The issue was with something in the air (mirror), above the ground.
A permanent fix to address the ground map latency issue is in process and will be implemented in the entire fleet within the next 30 days.
The second factor in the collision is that we were artificially constraining the vehicle to the right side of the road due to ambiguous and unpainted roadway. If we change that constraint to an advisory line (and allow the vehicle to cross the line to the left), we would have been far enough to the left to avoid collision (simulation success).
Solution Implementation: AVO training for extra caution related to protruding items like mirrors (short term), software changes coming in the next update and hotfix (within 30 days), and further improvement in the following update (within 60 days).
Until the tested software changes are implemented, we have advised the AVOs to take extra caution in these scenarios and to continue to disengage autonomy when desired. As always, we sacrifice autonomy for safety, as needed.",

Specifically, the L4 ADS was not in operation at any point in the 30 seconds prior to making contact with the concrete barrier.  
 
The event occurred as follows:
As the truck was being operated on the highway, within its mapped ODD, the driver and test engineer attempted to engage the ADS.  However, the ADS was not functional at that moment due to the computer unit not having been initialized, and should not have been attempted to be activated.  In short, this was a failed attempt to engage the system as a result of human error.  
 
The system has now been modified to prevent the ADS from attempting to engage unless the health of the system is fully functional to prevent human error from repeating this event.
 
When the erroneous attempt to engage occurred, the uninitialized vehicle control unit rotated the steering to the left, causing the truck to veer left.  The safety driver took control of the steering, and was able to steer accordingly, but not before the left front truck tire and left front quarter panel came into contact with the concrete barrier to the left of the lanes of travel.  
 
The contact resulted in a scuff to the left tire and damage to the radar unit extending from the left quarter panel.",

As required by the SGO, Pony.ai submitted a ""10-day"" update to the amended report on November [XXX], 2021. Subsequently, in a November [XXX], 2021 meeting with NHTSA, Pony.ai presented a full report regarding the crash and material facts and circumstances to a number of NHTSA officials, and answered the agency's questions. This supplemental ""Other"" Report is intended only to provide two minor technical corrections to Pony.ai's prior reports, in order to ensure the details of the written reports, as revised, are accurate. This is not a ""1-Day"", ""Monthly"" or ""Monthly-No Incidents"" Report. To facilitate a clear record, this ""Other"" Updated Report reproduces verbatim the narrative descriptions from the prior reports concerning this incident. 
UNEDITED NARRATIVE FROM ORIGINAL MONTHLY REPORT (11/[XXX]/21) AND AMENDED REPORT (11/[XXX]/21): On October [XXX], 2021, after turning right onto [XXX] from [XXX], the Pony.ai Autonomous Vehicle (""Pony.ai AV"") performed a left lane change maneuver in autonomous mode (SAE L4). While performing the lane change, the Pony.ai AV came into contact with a center divider on [XXX]. and the traffic sign that was posted on the divider. The Pony.ai AV suffered moderate damage to the front of the vehicle and the undercarriage. There were no injuries and no other vehicles involved. Fremont Police Department were called to report the incident and the damaged street sign. Pony.ai has subsequently worked with local authorities to resolve all issues related to the damaged sign. Please note that the latitude/longitude provided are GPS coordinates of the location address.
UNEDITED ADDITIONAL NARRATIVE FROM 10-DAY UPDATE: NHTSA has requested the Company to debrief the Agency on this incident. That meeting is scheduled for November 30, 2021.  Pony.ai will present a full updated report of the incident to NHTSA at that time and the current status of the Company's investigation.
TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS FOR THIS ""OTHER"" UPDATED REPORT (12/15/2021): Pony.ai provides the following corrections to its prior reports on the incident: (1) The Pony.ai AV did not turn onto [XXX] from [XXX] as first reported. Rather the Pony.ai AV was traveling straight on [XXX] and crossed through an intersection with [XXX] before entering the segment of [XXX] on which it changed lanes and subsequently had a collision; (2) Pony.ai has updated the VIN number of the subject vehicle in the data fields above, as there was one digit that was incorrect in our original reports due to a clerical error.",

Summary of incident (as Toyota received from May Mobility):
Leading up to the event, the autonomy system functioned as expected, following the route through the intersection, slowing appropriately for other road users and the red light. Vehicle autonomous behavior was performing as expected and did not require a takeover.
Description of event:
16:17:30 May vehicle, traveling East on [XXX], in full working order with no errors, autonomously navigates the [XXX] and [XXX] intersection.
16:17:35 May vehicle autonomously begins to slow to match the speed of a vehicle several car lengths ahead merging into our lane from the right.
16:17:37 By means of an accelerator pedal push the vehicle is moved into manual mode by the safety operator - from this point forward, the vehicle remains under control of the safety operator.
16:17:43 Manual acceleration command via the pedal increases.
16:17:44 Safety operator manually continues straight which, due to the slight change in angle of the road, brings the May vehicle into contact with the first vehicle to the right.
16:17:44 Safety operator manually applies brake.
16:17:45 With the manual brake command now at maximum the May vehicle makes contact with the second vehicle.
Vehicle indicators for manual or autonomy mode:
The visual indicator for autonomy was functioning properly and as expected in the time leading up to and during the event.
The audio communication device in the vehicle was functioning properly and was used to call for assistance and to report the incident.
